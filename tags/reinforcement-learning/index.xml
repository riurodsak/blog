I&amp;rsquo;ve recently written together with Jules Hedges about Reinforcement Learning using the Categorical Cybernetics framework (you can find the ACT2024 paper here). Here I would like to talk about the main construction, which I like to refer to as the &amp;ldquo;RL lens&amp;rdquo;.
Selected aspects of RL In modelling disciplines, one often faces the challenge of balancing three often conflicting aspects: representational elegance, the breadth of examples to capture, and the depth or specificity in capturing those examples of interest.</description></item></channel></rss>
